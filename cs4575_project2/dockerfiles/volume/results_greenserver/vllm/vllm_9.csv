Issue Description:
TSQL - L031 incorrectly triggers ""Avoid using aliases in join condition"" when no join present
## Expected Behaviour

Both of these queries should pass, the only difference is the addition of a table alias 'a':

1/ no alias

```
SELECT [hello]
FROM
    mytable
```

2/ same query with alias

```
SELECT a.[hello]
FROM
    mytable AS a
```

## Observed Behaviour

1/ passes
2/ fails with: L031: Avoid using aliases in join condition.

But there is no join condition :-)

## Steps to Reproduce

Lint queries above

## Dialect

TSQL

## Version

sqlfluff 0.6.9
Python 3.6.9

## Configuration

N/A


Hints (if any):
Actually, re-reading the docs I think this is the intended behaviour... closing

Issue Description:
Rule L060 could give a specific error message
At the moment rule L060 flags something like this:

```
L:  21 | P:   9 | L060 | Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL' or 'NVL'.
```

Since we likely know the wrong word, it might be nice to actually flag that instead of both `IFNULL` and `NVL` - like most of the other rules do.

That is it should flag this:

```
L:  21 | P:   9 | L060 | Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'IFNULL'.
```
 Or this:

```
L:  21 | P:   9 | L060 | Use 'COALESCE' instead of 'NVL'.
```

As appropriate.

What do you think @jpy-git ?

Issue Description:
Extra space when first field moved to new line in a WITH statement
Note, the query below uses a `WITH` statement. If I just try to fix the SQL within the CTE, this works fine.

Given the following SQL:

```sql
WITH example AS (
    SELECT my_id,
        other_thing,
        one_more
    FROM
        my_table
)

SELECT *
FROM example
```

## Expected Behaviour

after running `sqlfluff fix` I'd expect (`my_id` gets moved down and indented properly):

```sql
WITH example AS (
    SELECT
        my_id,
        other_thing,
        one_more
    FROM
        my_table
)

SELECT *
FROM example
```

## Observed Behaviour

after running `sqlfluff fix` we get (notice that `my_id` is indented one extra space)

```sql
WITH example AS (
    SELECT
         my_id,
        other_thing,
        one_more
    FROM
        my_table
)

SELECT *
FROM example
```

## Steps to Reproduce

Noted above. Create a file with the initial SQL and fun `sqfluff fix` on it.

## Dialect

Running with default config.

## Version
Include the output of `sqlfluff --version` along with your Python version

sqlfluff, version 0.7.0
Python 3.7.5

## Configuration

Default config.



Hints (if any):
Does running `sqlfluff fix` again correct the SQL?
@tunetheweb yes, yes it does. Is that something that the user is supposed to do (run it multiple times) or is this indeed a bug?
Ideally not, but there are some circumstances where itâ€™s understandable that would happen. This however seems an easy enough example where it should not happen.
This appears to be a combination of rules L036, L003, and L039 not playing nicely together.

The original error is rule L036 and it produces this:

```sql
WITH example AS (
    SELECT
my_id,
        other_thing,
        one_more
    FROM
        my_table
)

SELECT *
FROM example
```

That is, it moves the `my_id` down to the newline but does not even try to fix the indentation.

Then we have another run through and L003 spots the lack of indentation and fixes it by adding the first set of whitespace:

```sql
WITH example AS (
    SELECT
    my_id,
        other_thing,
        one_more
    FROM
        my_table
)

SELECT *
FROM example
```

Then we have another run through and L003 spots that there still isn't enough indentation and fixes it by adding the second set of whitespace:

```sql
WITH example AS (
    SELECT
        my_id,
        other_thing,
        one_more
    FROM
        my_table
)

SELECT *
FROM example
```

At this point we're all good.

However then L039 has a look. It never expects two sets of whitespace following a new line and is specifically coded to only assume one set of spaces (which it normally would be if the other rules hadn't interfered as it would be parsed as one big space), so it think's the second set is too much indentation, so it replaces it with a single space.

Then another run and L003 and the whitespace back in so we end up with two indents, and a single space.

Luckily the fix is easier than that explanation. PR coming up...

Hints (if any):
Sounds similar to #1458 where we should handle ""empty"" statement/files better?
Nope, that's the different issue. I doubt that solving one of them would help in other one. I think both issues should stay, just in the case.
But what do you think @tunetheweb - should it just ignore these `;;` or raise something like `Found unparsable section:`? 
Just tested and in BigQuery it's an error.
Interestingly Oracle is fine with it.

I think it should be raised as `Found unparsable section`.

Issue Description:
dbt postgres fix command errors with UnicodeEncodeError and also wipes the .sql file
_If this is a parsing or linting issue, please include a minimal SQL example which reproduces the issue, along with the `sqlfluff parse` output, `sqlfluff lint` output and `sqlfluff fix` output when relevant._

## Expected Behaviour
Violation failure notice at a minimum, without wiping the file. Would like a way to ignore the known error at a minimum as --noqa is not getting past this. Actually would expect --noqa to totally ignore this.

## Observed Behaviour
Reported error: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192' in position 120: character maps to <undefined>`

## Steps to Reproduce
SQL file:
```sql
SELECT
    reacted_table_name_right.descendant_id AS category_id,
    string_agg(redacted_table_name_left.name, ' â†’ ' ORDER BY reacted_table_name_right.generations DESC) AS breadcrumbs -- noqa
FROM {{ ref2('redacted_schema_name', 'redacted_table_name_left') }} AS redacted_table_name_left
INNER JOIN {{ ref2('redacted_schema_name', 'reacted_table_name_right') }} AS reacted_table_name_right
    ON redacted_table_name_left.id = order_issue_category_hierarchies.ancestor_id

I get a dbt-related error -- can you provide your project file as well? Also, what operating system are you running this on? I tested a simplified (non-dbt) version of your file on my Mac, and it worked okay.

```
dbt.exceptions.DbtProjectError: Runtime Error
  no dbt_project.yml found at expected path /Users/bhart/dev/sqlfluff/dbt_project.yml
```
Never mind the questions above -- I managed to reproduce the error in a sample dbt project. Taking a look now...
@Tumble17: Have you tried setting the `encoding` parameter in `.sqlfluff`? Do you know what encoding you're using? The default is `autodetect`, and SQLFluff ""thinks"" the file uses ""Windows-1252"" encoding, which I assume is incorrect -- that's why SQLFluff is unable to write out the updated file.
I added this line to the first section of your `.sqlfluff`, and now it seems to work. I'll look into changing the behavior of `sqlfluff fix` so it doesn't erase the file when it fails.

```
encoding = utf-8

Issue Description:
3.0: DateTime fields cannot be used as inner field for List or Tuple fields
Between releases 3.0.0rc8 and 3.0.0rc9, `DateTime` fields have started throwing an error when being instantiated as inner fields of container fields like `List` or `Tuple`. The snippet below works in <=3.0.0rc8 and throws the error below in >=3.0.0rc9 (and, worryingly, 3.0.0):

```python
from marshmallow import fields, Schema

class MySchema(Schema):
    times = fields.List(fields.DateTime())

s = MySchema()
```

Traceback:
```

    or getattr(schema.opts, self.SCHEMA_OPTS_VAR_NAME)
AttributeError: 'List' object has no attribute 'opts'
```

It seems like it's treating the parent field as a Schema without checking that it is indeed a schema, so the `schema.opts` statement fails as fields don't have an `opts` attribute.


Hints (if any):
Thanks for reporting. I don't think I'll have time to look into this until the weekend. Would you like to send a PR? 
I'm afraid I don't have any time either, and I don't really have enough context on the `_bind_to_schema` process to make sure I'm not breaking stuff.
OK, no problem. @lafrech Will you have a chance to look into this?
I've found the patch below to fix the minimal example above, but I'm not really sure what it's missing out on or how to test it properly:

When reworking container stuff, I changed

```py
        self.inner.parent = self
        self.inner.name = field_name
```
into

```py
        self.inner._bind_to_schema(field_name, self)
```

AFAIR, I did this merely to avoid duplication. On second thought, I think it was the right thing to do, not only for duplication but to actually bind inner fields to the `Schema`.

Reverting this avoids the error but the inner field's `_bind_to_schema` method is not called so I'm not sure it is desirable.

I think we really mean to call that method, not only in this case but also generally.

Changing

```py
            or getattr(schema.opts, self.SCHEMA_OPTS_VAR_NAME)
```

into

```py
            or getattr(self.root.opts, self.SCHEMA_OPTS_VAR_NAME)
```

might be a better fix. Can anyone confirm (@sloria, @deckar01)?

The fix in https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues/1357#issuecomment-523465528 removes the error but also the feature: `DateTime` fields buried into container fields won't respect the format set in the `Schema`.

I didn't double-check that but AFAIU, the change I mentioned above (in container stuff rework) was the right thing to do. The feature was already broken (format set in `Schema` not respected if `DateTime` field in container field) and that's just one of the issues that may arise due to the inner field not being bound to the `Schema`. But I may be wrong.
On quick glance, your analysis and fix look correct @lafrech 
Let's do that, then.

Not much time either. The first who gets the time can do it.

For the non-reg tests :

1/ a test that checks the format set in the schema is respected if the `DateTime` field is in a container field

2/ a set of tests asserting the `_bind_to_schema` method of inner fields `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple` is called from container fields (we can use `DateTime` with the same test case for that)

Perhaps 1/ is useless if 2/ is done.

Issue Description:
temperature.fuentes errors when given tz-aware inputs on pandas>=1.0.0
**Describe the bug**
When the weather timeseries inputs to `temperature.fuentes` have tz-aware index, an internal call to `np.diff(index)` returns an array of `Timedelta` objects instead of an array of nanosecond ints, throwing an error immediately after.  The error only happens when using pandas>=1.0.0; using 0.25.3 runs successfully, but emits the warning:

**Describe the bug**
I was using pvlib for sometime now and until now I was always passing a big dataframe containing readings of a long period. Because of some changes in our software architecture, I need to pass the weather readings as a single reading (a dataframe with only one row) and I noticed that for readings that GHI-DHI are zero pvlib fails to calculate the output and returns below error while the same code executes correctly with weather information that has non-zero GHI-DHI:

I have to mention that for now the workaround that I am using is to pass the weather data as a dataframe with two rows, the first row is a good weather data that pvlib can process and the second row is the incoming weather reading (I can also post that code if you want).

**Expected behavior**
PVlib should have consistent behavior and regardless of GHI-DHI readings.

**Versions:**
```python
>>> import pvlib
>>> import pandas
>>> pvlib.__version__
'0.9.1'
>>> pandas.__version__
'1.4.3'
``` 
 - python: 3.10.6
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS


Hints (if any):
Confirmed. This appears to be an oversight in `pvlib.tools._golden_section_DataFrame` involving error messaging, likely introduced with #1089 .

In this code when processing the content of `data`, photocurrent is 0., hence the shunt resistance is infinite and v_oc is 0. That sets the range for the golden section search to be [0., 0.]. [iterlimit](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/blob/582b956c63c463e5178fbb7a88fa545fa5b1c257/pvlib/tools.py#L358) is then -infinity, which skips the loop (`iterations <= iterlimit`) but since `iterations > iterlimit` raises the ""Iterations exceeded..."" exception.

Issue Description:
PVSystem with single Array generates an error
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

When a PVSystem has a single Array, you can't assign just the Array instance when constructing the PVSystem.

```
mount = pvlib.pvsystem.FixedMount(surface_tilt=35, surface_azimuth=180)
array = pvlib.pvsystem.Array(mount=mount)
pv = pvlib.pvsystem.PVSystem(arrays=array)

      4 array = pvlib.pvsystem.Array(mount=mount)

--> 253         elif len(arrays) == 0:
    254             raise ValueError(""PVSystem must have at least one Array. ""
    255                              ""If you want to create a PVSystem instance ""

TypeError: object of type 'Array' has no len()

```

Not a bug per se, since the PVSystem docstring requests that `arrays` be iterable. Still, a bit inconvenient to have to do this

```
mount = pvlib.pvsystem.FixedMount(surface_tilt=35, surface_azimuth=180)
array = pvlib.pvsystem.Array(mount=mount)
pv = pvlib.pvsystem.PVSystem(arrays=[array])
```

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Handle `arrays=array` where `array` is an instance of `Array`

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Status quo - either make the single Array into a list, or use the PVSystem kwargs.

pvlib.irradiance.reindl() model generates NaNs when GHI = 0
**Describe the bug**
The reindl function should give zero sky diffuse when GHI is zero. Instead it generates NaN or Inf values due to ""term3"" having a quotient that divides by GHI.  

**Expected behavior**
The reindl function should result in zero sky diffuse when GHI is zero.

value = np.random.seed(1234)

### Expected behavior
There should be no future warnings.

### python -c ""from astroid import __pkginfo__; print(__pkginfo__.version)"" output
2.12.13


Hints (if any):
This seems very similar to https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/pull/1514 that was fixed in 2.12.0.
I'm running 2.12.13 (> 2.12.0), so the fix isn't working in this case?
I don't know why #1514 did not fix this, I think we were capturing both stdout and stderr, so this will need some investigation. My guess would be that there's somewhere else to apply the same method to.
Hello, 
I see the same error with pylint on our tool [demcompare](https://github.com/CNES/demcompare). Pylint version:
```
pylint --version
pylint 2.15.9
astroid 2.12.13
Python 3.8.10 (default, Nov 14 2022, 12:59:47) 
[GCC 9.4.0]
```
I confirm the weird astroid lower warning and I don't know how to bypass it with pylint checking. 

```
pylint demcompare 
/home/duboise/work/src/demcompare/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/astroid/raw_building.py:470: FutureWarning: In the future `np.long` will be defined as the corresponding NumPy scalar.  (This may have returned Python scalars in past versions.
  getattr(sys.modules[modname], name)
... (four times)
```

Thanks in advance if there is a solution
Cordially

> Thanks in advance if there is a solution

while annoying the warning does not make pylint fail. Just ignore it. In a CI you can just check pylint return code. It will return 0 as expected
I agree, even if annoying because it feels our code as a problem somewhere, the CI with pylint doesn't fail indeed. Thanks for the answer that confirm to not bother for now. 
That might be fine in a CI environment, but for users, ultimately, ignoring warnings becomes difficult when there are too many such warnings. I would like to see this fixed.
Oh, it was not an argument in favour of not fixing it. It was just to point out that it is not a breaking problem. It is ""just"" a lot of quite annoying warnings. I am following the issue because it annoys me too. So I am in the same ""I hope they will fix it"" boat

That PR only addressed import-time. This `FutureWarning` is emitted by numpy's package-level `__getattr__` method, not during import.

Issue Description:
astroid 2.9.1 breaks pylint with missing __init__.py: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file __init__.py
### Steps to reproduce
> Steps provided are for Windows 11, but initial problem found in Ubuntu 20.04

> Update 2022-01-04: Corrected repro steps and added more environment details

1. Set up simple repo with following structure (all files can be empty):
```
root_dir/
|--src/
|----project/ # Notice the missing __init__.py
|------file.py # It can be empty, but I added `import os` at the top
|----__init__.py
```
2. Open a command prompt
3. `cd root_dir`
4. `python -m venv venv`
5. `venv/Scripts/activate`
6. `pip install pylint astroid==2.9.1` # I also repro'd on the latest, 2.9.2
7. `pylint src/project` # Updated from `pylint src`
8. Observe failure:
```
src\project\__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file src\project\__init__.py:
```

### Current behavior
Fails with `src\project\__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file src\project\__init__.py:`

### Expected behavior
Does not fail with error.
> If you replace step 6 with `pip install pylint astroid==2.9.0`, you get no failure with an empty output - since no files have content

### `python -c ""from astroid import __pkginfo__; print(__pkginfo__.version)""` output
2.9.1

`python 3.9.1`
`pylint 2.12.2 `



This issue has been observed with astroid `2.9.1` and `2.9.2`


Hints (if any):
I can't seem to reproduce this in my `virtualenv`. This might be specific to `venv`? Needs some further investigation.
@interifter Which version of `pylint` are you using?
Right, ``pip install pylint astroid==2.9.0``, will keep the local version if you already have one, so I thought it was ``2.12.2`` but that could be false. In fact it probably isn't 2.12.2. For the record, you're not supposed to set the version of ``astroid`` yourself, pylint does, and bad thing will happen if you try to set the version of an incompatible astroid. We might want to update the issue's template to have this information next.
My apologies... I updated the repro steps with a critical missed detail: `pylint src/project`, instead of `pylint src`

But I verified that either with, or without, `venv`, the issue is reproduced.

Also, I never have specified the `astroid` version, before. 

However, this isn't the first time the issue has been observed.
Back in early 2019, a [similar issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48024049/pylint-raises-error-if-directory-doesnt-contain-init-py-file) was observed with either `astroid 2.2.0` or `isort 4.3.5`, which led me to try pinning `astroid==2.9.0`, which worked.

Issue Description:
getitem does not infer the actual unpacked value
When trying to call `Dict.getitem()` on a context where we have a dict unpacking of anything beside a real dict, astroid currently raises an `AttributeError: 'getitem'`, which has 2 problems:

- The object might be a reference against something constant, this pattern is usually seen when we have different sets of dicts that extend each other, and all of their values are inferrable. 
- We can have something that is uninferable, but in that case instead of an `AttributeError` I think it makes sense to raise the usual `AstroidIndexError` which is supposed to be already handled by the downstream.


Here is a short reproducer;

```py
from astroid import parse


source = """"""
X = {
    'A': 'B'
}

Y = {
    **X
}

KEY = 'A'
""""""

tree = parse(source)

first_dict = tree.body[0].value
second_dict = tree.body[1].value
key = tree.body[2].value

print(f'{first_dict.getitem(key).value = }')
print(f'{second_dict.getitem(key).value = }')


```

```

Version: 2.13
Instance ID: pylint-dev__astroid-1866

Issue Description:
""TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__"" while running type inference in version 2.12.x
### Steps to reproduce

I have no concise reproducer. Exception happens every time I run pylint on some internal code, with astroid 2.12.10 and 2.12.12 (debian bookworm). It does _not_ happen with earlier versions of astroid (not with version 2.9). The pylinted code itself is ""valid"", it runs in production here.

### Current behavior

When running pylint on some code, I get this exception:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pylint/utils/ast_walker.py"", line 90, in walk

```

### Expected behavior

TypeError exception should not happen

Hi @crosser, thanks for the report.

> I have no concise reproducer. 

We might be able to help you distill one.

`pylint` produces a crash report, and shows the link in your terminal, like this:
```shell
************* Module a
a.py:1:0: F0002: a.py: Fatal error while checking 'a.py'. Please open an issue in our bug tracker so we address this. There is a pre-filled template that you can use in '/Users/.../Library/Caches/pylint/pylint-crash-2022-10-29-08-48-25.txt'. (astroid-error)
```
The offending file is at the top of the crash report. If the code is too long, or contains sensitive information, you can use the knowledge that the crash happened in `_infer_str_format_call` to look for calls to `.format()` on strings. You should be able to then just provide us those calls--and enough surrounding code to rebuild the objects you provided to `format()`. 

Doing this would be a tremendous help!

No, not really, it does not. I am attaching a (censored) stderr from running the test. The line in the source code that apparently triggers the problem is pretty innocuous:

```
    @property
    def vnet_id(self):  # <---- this is the line 266 that is mentioned in the ""Exception on node"" message
        if ...:
```
There is very similar property definition right before this one, that does not trigger the problem.

_I_ did not provide any objects to `format()`, astroid did...
Thanks for providing the traceback.

> No, not really, it does not. I am attaching a (censored) stderr from running the test. 

I see now that it's because you're invoking pylint from a unittest, so your test is managing the output.

> The line in the source code that apparently triggers the problem is pretty innocuous:

The deeper failure is on the call in line 268, not the function def on line 266. Is there anything you can sanitize and tell us about line 268? Thanks again for providing the help.

When I run pylint by hand

```
pylint --jobs=0 --rcfile=test/style/pylint.conf <module-name> | tee /tmp/pyerr.txt
```
there is still no ""Fatal error while checking ..."" message in the output

Oh yes, there is a `something.format()` in that line! But the ""something"" is a literal string:
```
    @property
    def vnet_id(self):
        if self.backend == ""something"":
            return ""{:04x}{:04x}n{:d}"".format(  # <---- this is line 268
                self.<some-attr>, self.<another-attr>, self.<third-attr>
            )
        if self.backend == ""somethingelse"":
            return ""h{:08}n{:d}"".format(self.<more-attr>, self.<and more>)
        return None
```

Thanks, that was very helpful. Here is a reproducer:
```python
x = ""{:c}"".format(None)
```

Hints (if any):
Thank you for opening the issue.
I don't believe `Unknown().as_string()` is ever called regularly. AFAIK it's only used during inference. What should the string representation of an `Unknown` node be? So not sure this needs to be addressed.
Probably just `'Unknown'`.
It's mostly only a problem when we do something like this:

```python
inferred = infer(node)
if inferred is not Uninferable:
    if inferred.as_string().contains(some_value):
        ...
```
So for the most part, as long as it doesn't crash we're good.

Rectilinear grid does not allow Sequences as inputs
### Describe the bug, what's wrong, and what you expected.

Rectilinear grid gives an error when `Sequence`s are passed in, but `ndarray` are ok.

### Steps to reproduce the bug.

This doesn't work
```python
import pyvista as pv
pv.RectilinearGrid([0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1])
```

This works
```py
import pyvista as pv
import numpy as np
pv.RectilinearGrid(np.ndarray([0, 1]), np.ndarray([0, 1]), np.ndarray([0, 1]))

Issue Description:
Dataset.to_json_dict can still generate exceptions when suppress_invalid_tags=True
**Describe the bug**
I'm using `Dataset.to_json_dict(suppress_invalid_tags=True)` and can live with losing invalid tags.  Unfortunately, I can still trigger an exception with something like  `2.0` in an `IS` field.

**Expected behavior**
to_json_dict shouldn't throw an error about an invalid tag when `suppress_invalid_tags` is enabled.

My thought was simply to move the `data_element = self[key]` into the try/catch block that's right after it.

**Steps To Reproduce**

Issue Description:
Error : a bytes-like object is required, not 'MultiValue'
Hello,

I am getting following error while updating the tag LongTrianglePointIndexList (0066,0040),
**TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'MultiValue'**

I noticed that the error  gets produced only when the VR is given as ""OL"" , works fine with ""OB"", ""OF"" etc.

sample code (assume 'lineSeq' is the dicom dataset sequence):
```python
import pydicom
import array
data=list(range(1,10))
data=array.array('H', indexData).tostring()  # to convert to unsigned short
lineSeq.add_new(0x00660040, 'OL', data)   
ds.save_as(""mydicom"")
```
outcome: **TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'MultiValue'**

using version - 2.0.0.0

Any help is appreciated.

Thank you


Hints (if any):
Also tried following code to get the byte string, but same error.
1. data=array.array('L', indexData).tostring()  # to convert to long -> same error
2. data=array.array('Q', indexData).tostring()  # to convert to long long -> same error


O* VRs should be `bytes`. Use `array.tobytes()` instead of `tostring()`?

Also, in the future if have an issue it's much more helpful if you post the full traceback rather than the error since we can look at it to figure out where in the code the exception is occurring.

It would also help if you posted the version of Python you're using. 

This works fine for me with Python 3.9 and pydicom 2.1.2:
```python
from pydicom import Dataset
import array

arr = array.array('H', range(10))
ds = Dataset()
ds.is_little_endian = True
ds.is_implicit_VR = False
ds.LongTrianglePointIndexList = arr.tobytes()
print(ds[""LongTrianglePointIndexList""].VR)  # 'OL'
ds.save_as('temp.dcm')
```
This also works fine:
```python
ds = Dataset()
ds.add_new(0x00660040, 'OL', arr.tobytes())
```
Thank you for the answer.
Unfortunately the error still persists with above code.
Please find the attached detailed error.
[error.txt](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/files/6661451/error.txt)

One more information is that the 'ds' is actually read from a file in the disk (ds=pydicom.read_file(filename)). 
and this byte array is stored under the following sequence
ds[0x0066,0x0002][0][0x0066,0x0013][0][0x0066,0x0028][0][0x0066,0x0040] = arr.tobytes()

pydicom - 2.0.0.0
python - 3.6.4

Thank you.
Could you post a minimal code sample that reproduces the issue please?

If you're using something like this:
`ds[0x0066,0x0002][0][0x0066,0x0013][0][0x0066,0x0028][0][0x0066,0x0040] = arr.tobytes()`

Then you're missing the `.value` assignment:
`ds[0x0066,0x0002][0][0x0066,0x0013][0][0x0066,0x0028][0][0x0066,0x0040].value = arr.tobytes()`
Hello,
above code line I just mentioned to give an idea where the actual data is stored (tree level).

Please find the actual code used below,
```python
import pydicom
from pydicom.sequence import Sequence
from pydicom.dataelem import DataElement
from pydicom.dataset import Dataset

ds = pydicom.read_file(filename)
surfaceSeq= ds[0x0066,0x0002]

#// read existing sequence items in the dataset
seqlist=[]
for n in surfaceSeq:
    seqlist.append(n)

newDs = Dataset()
 
surfaceMeshPrimitiveSq = Dataset()
lineSeq = Dataset()
indexData = list(range(1,100))
indexData = array.array('H', indexData)
indexData = indexData.tobytes()
lineSeq.add_new(0x00660040, 'OL', indexData) 
surfaceMeshPrimitiveSq.add_new(0x00660028, 'SQ', [lineSeq])
newDs.add_new(0x00660013, 'SQ', [surfaceMeshPrimitiveSq])

#add the new sequnce item to the list
seqlist.append(newDs)
ds[0x0066,0x0002] = DataElement(0x00660002,""SQ"",seqlist)
ds.save_as(filename)
```
OK, I can reproduce with:
```python

import array

from pydicom import Dataset
from pydicom.uid import ExplicitVRLittleEndian

ds = Dataset()
ds.file_meta = Dataset()
ds.file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID = ExplicitVRLittleEndian

b = array.array('H', range(100)).tobytes()

ds.LongPrimitivePointIndexList = b
ds.save_as('1421.dcm')
```
And `print(ds)` gives:
```

I think this is because the byte value is hitting the hex for the backslash character during assignment. Ouch, that's kinda nasty.

Issue Description:
pydicom should not define handler, formatter and log level.
The `config` module (imported when pydicom is imported) defines a handler and set the log level for the pydicom logger. This should not be the case IMO. It should be the responsibility of the client code of pydicom to configure the logging module to its convenience. Otherwise one end up having multiple logs record as soon as pydicom is imported:

Example:
```
Could not import pillow
2018-03-25 15:27:29,744 :: DEBUG :: pydicom 
  Could not import pillow
Could not import jpeg_ls
2018-03-25 15:27:29,745 :: DEBUG :: pydicom 
  Could not import jpeg_ls
Could not import gdcm
2018-03-25 15:27:29,745 :: DEBUG :: pydicom 
  Could not import gdcm
``` 
Or am I missing something?


Hints (if any):
In addition, I don't understand what the purpose of the `config.debug` function since the default behavor of the logging module in absence of configuartion seems to already be the one you want.

From https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#configuring-logging-for-a-library:

> If the using application does not use logging, and library code makes logging calls, then (as described in the previous section) events of severity WARNING and greater will be printed to sys.stderr. This is regarded as the best default behaviour.

and

>**It is strongly advised that you do not add any handlers other than NullHandler to your libraryâ€™s loggers.** This is because the configuration of handlers is the prerogative of the application developer who uses your library. The application developer knows their target audience and what handlers are most appropriate for their application: if you add handlers â€˜under the hoodâ€™, you might well interfere with their ability to carry out unit tests and deliver logs which suit their requirements. 

I think you make good points here.  I support changing the logging to comply with python's suggested behavior.

> In addition, I don't understand what the purpose of the config.debug function

One reason is that the core loop in pydicom (data_element_generator in filereader.py) is extremely optimized for speed - it checks the `debugging` flag set by config.debug, to avoid composing messages and doing function calls to logger when not needed.

Issue Description:
Make PersonName3 iterable
```python
from pydicom import Dataset

ds = Dataset()
ds.PatientName = 'SomeName'

'S' in ds.PatientName
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: argument of type 'PersonName3' is not iterable
```

I'm not really sure if this is intentional or if PN elements should support `str` methods. And yes I know I can `str(ds.PatientName)` but it's a bit silly, especially when I keep having to write exceptions to my element iterators just for PN elements.


Hints (if any):
I think it is reasonable to support at least some `str` methods (definitely `__contains__` for the example above), but there are many that don't make a lot of sense in this context though - e.g. `join`, `ljust`, `maketrans`, `splitlines` just to name a few, but I suppose each would either never be actually used or would have no effect.

I have a vague memory that one or more of the `PersonName` classes was at one time subclassed from `str`, or at least that it was discussed... does anyone remember?  Maybe it would be easier now with only Python 3 supported.
`PersonName` was derived from `str` or `unicode` in Python 2, but that caused a number of problems, which is why you switched to `PersonName3` in Python 3, I think. I agree though that it makes sense to implement `str` methods, either by implementing some of them, or generically by adding `__getattr__` that converts it to `str` and applies the attribute to that string.

Issue Description:
from_json does not correctly convert BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements
**Describe the bug**
When a DICOM object contains large data elements in SQ elements and is converted to JSON, those elements are correctly turned into BulkDataURI's. However, when the JSON is converted back to DICOM using from_json, the BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements are not converted back and warnings are thrown.

**Expected behavior**
The BulkDataURI's in SQ data elements get converted back correctly.

**Steps To Reproduce**
Take the `waveform_ecg.dcm` in the test data, convert it to JSON, and then convert the JSON to DICOM
